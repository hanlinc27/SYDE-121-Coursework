 /*
 To test values for the program:
 Utilized the 1048 sample case as well as the boundary points.
 Since the initial weight is stored as a 32 bit integer, the maximum value can be 2,147,483,647 kg and the minimum is 0 kg. These boundaries are the test cases that were used for weight_given.
        Thus, the valid range for which the program will work is from 0kg to 2147483647 kg.

/*
 Screen Output
 
 Please enter the initial weight:
 1048
 Weight entered is : 1048
 Number of 150 weights: 6
 Number of 50 weights: 2
 Number of 30 weights: 1
 Nmber of 15 weights: 1
 Number of 1 weights: 3
 Program ended with exit code: 0

//Test Case with Maximum Value
/*
 Please enter the initial weight:
 2147483647
 Weight entered is : 2147483647lbs
 Number of 150 weights: 14316557
 Number of 50 weights: 1
 Number of 30 weights: 1

//Demonstrates that it conforms to theory where the max value that can be stored in a 32 bit integer
/*
//The logic of how this program should operate is:
// accept weight from user
 - compute amount of weights of each mass to match
 - output answer to screen
