  The values used to test the program logic was through entering the boundary points of acceptable values.
  Since the year it begins with is 2000, that's the leftmost boundary point, with the right going towards infinity.
  However, the max year is the max value that population can be. Since population is stored as a 64 bit float, the max value it can contain is 3.4 * 10^38. Working backwards, we then know that the max year that can be computed inside
  of the computer program is the year 6346. Thus, the range of years is 2000 to 6346. 
  
  
  Program Output:
 The population for the year : 2018 , is: 8.59998 billion people
 The population for the year : 2025 , is: 9.89233 billion people
 The population for the year : 2050 , is: 16.3097 billion people
 The population for the year : 2100 , is: 44.3343 billion people
 Program ended with exit code: 0

 /*
  The logic of how this program works is that it should take an input year from the user,
  compute it inside of the population equation and output that value to screen
